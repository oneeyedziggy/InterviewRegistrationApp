# First Challenge: User Registration

## Build a user registration form using React and TypeScript. The form should have the following fields: first name, last name, email, and password. Implement the following features.

    * Input validation for email and password fields (e.g., valid email format, minimum password length).
    * Display error messages for invalid inputs.
    * Disable the submit button until all inputs are valid.
    * After successful registration, display a confirmation message with the user's full name.
